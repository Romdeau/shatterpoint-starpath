# Product Guidelines - Shatterpoint Starpath

## Visual Aesthetic & Design Language
### Galactic & Industrial ("The Andor Aesthetic")
- **Core Theme:** Inspired by the N-S9 Starpath unit; clean, utilitarian, and industrial. 
- **Palette:** High-contrast color schemes with a focus on data readability. Use dark backgrounds with sharp, accented foreground colors (e.g., terminal greens, command-center oranges, or imperial reds).
- **Interface:** Utilitarian design with "industrial" edges. Avoid over-decorated elements; prioritize a "form follows function" approach that feels like a piece of Star Wars technology.

## User Experience & Interface
### Tactical Hierarchy
- **Primary Information:** Critical game stats (Health, Force, Struggle) must be immediately visible and color-coded for high-glanceability during a match.
- **Navigation:** Use a layered or tabbed view. The main board state (Struggle Tracker, general Force pool) should remain easily accessible while allowing users to deep-dive into specific unit card details without losing context.
- **Accessibility:** Large touch targets and high-readability fonts are mandatory for use in various lighting conditions at a gaming table.

## Tone & Messaging
### Prose Style
- **Atmospheric Fluff:** Use "In-Universe Utility" prose for non-functional elements. Loading screens, empty states, and "about" sections should use terminology like "Syncing Starpath Unit," "Establishing Comms Link," or "Scanning Sector."
- **Functional Interface:** All active gameplay elements, instructions, and settings must use functional and direct language. Clarity is paramount to prevent errors during complex game turns.
- **Legal & Community:** Maintain a clear, friendly reminder of the tool's fan-made nature: "Community tool. Not affiliated with Atomic Mass Games."
